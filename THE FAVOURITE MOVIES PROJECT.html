<h1>The Best Movies According to Onah Adaeze</h1> <h2>My Top Three Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ten Things I Hate about You</h3> <p>This is a high school movie that captures all the teenage cliches that we all love so much,
but then, the movie is so much more than glorifying popular cliches.
It celebrates the beauty of being unique and an excusive individual in the midst of stereotypes.
The character, Kat is my absolute favourite. If you are a feminist, then be prepared to love her quirky sarcasm.</p>

<h3>The Fault in our Stars</h3> <p>This movie is one of those absolutely sad movies that is so beautifully profound and incredibly witty.
Hazel Grace goes to group therapy and falls in love with the charismatic and incredibly charming Augustus Waters.
Their love is literally out of this world. It is timeless and totally unforgettable.</p>

<h3>Keith</h3> <p>I watched this movie at a time when I was coming to grasp the fact that today's modern relationships are nothing
but messy and incredibly complicated. Keith tells a love story between two high schoolers that is both intense and highly toxic.
While watching the movie, I kept holding my breath, waiting for the main leads to finally kiss. At the same time, they drove me crazy,
I couldn't wait to tear them apart from each other.
If you are the type that likes an angsty kind of romance, then this movie is definitely for you.</p>
